This small demo app is built using UIKit and WebKit. In the ViewController file, the declared websites array can be changed, and new elements can be added to the array and will appear in a table view. Adding new elements to the array in the format of website.domain will add a new clickable row to your table. And you are able to open your new favorite website.
